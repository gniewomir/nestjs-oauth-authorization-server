# Architecture Design Documentâ€”Bounded Contexts

Each directory under domain is supposed to be a `BoundedContext`

Therefore,

  * but tasks have no business in knowing properties of `User` related to its authentication or PIIs, just that the registered user with that ID exists and maybe in future some preferences of this person
