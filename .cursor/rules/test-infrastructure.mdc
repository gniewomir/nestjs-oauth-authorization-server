## What is test infrastructure? 
- All classes contained in files matching globs `**/*/*in-memory.ts`, `**/*/*fake.ts`, `**/*/*double.ts`, `**/*/*mother.ts`

## Rules they need to adhere to
- They MUST NOT be decorated with `@Injectable()` decorator. (Regardles of where they are placed, they are not part of production code, and should not be available via dependancy injection container outside testing suites.)
