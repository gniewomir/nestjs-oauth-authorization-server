## General rules
- before running each command run `nvm use` to ensure correct node and npm version

## Scripts 
- run `npm build` to build project when needed
- always run `npm run format` after introducing changes to the code to format code correctly
- always run `npm run lint` after introducing changes to the code to lint code 
- always run `npm test` after introducing changes to the code to test code 

## Database migrations 
- after changing database entities (glob `**/*/*.entity.ts`) always generate migrations and migrate database
- always run `npm build` before generating migrations
- to generate migration from changes made to the TypeOrm entities, run `npm run migration:generate --name=MIGRATION-NAME`

- to apply migrations run `npm run migration:run`
