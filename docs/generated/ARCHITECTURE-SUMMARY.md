- **Architecture Decisions**: Reference [ARCHITECTURE-LAYERS.md](./ARCHITECTURE-LAYERS.md) for structural guidance

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design
- Business logic is centralized in the domain layer
- Domain objects enforce business rules and invariants
- Domain interfaces define contracts for other layers

### 2. Layered Architecture
- Clear separation of concerns across layers
- Strict dependency direction (no upward dependencies)
- Each layer has specific responsibilities

### 3. Dependency Inversion
- Domain layer defines interfaces
- Infrastructure layer implements interfaces
- Application layer depends on abstractions

### 4. Testability
- Domain logic can be tested in isolation
- Infrastructure can be mocked or replaced
- Comprehensive testing strategies at all levels

### 5. Maintainability
- Clear structure and organization
- Well-defined patterns and conventions
- Easy to understand and modify
